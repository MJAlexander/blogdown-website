My research interests broadly fall into three areas:

__Statistical demography:__ I develop methods to improve estimates and forecasts of demographic and health indicators in situations where the available data are sparse or unreliable. This work involves combining demographic and statistical methods to estimate outcomes in developing countries, minority populations, and in small geographic areas. 

__Health and mortality inequalities:__ I research how disparities in health and mortality outcomes are changing over time. Recent and current work involves studying the evolution of the opioid epidemic in the United States and Canada. 

__Using non-traditional data sources in demographic research:__ I focus on developing methods to overcome biases and data quality issues to take advantage of new data sources such as web and social media data, and text data.

# Working papers where there is not so much working happening
- **Alexander, M.**, '[Temporal smoothers for use in demographic estimation and projection](/pdf/temporal_smoothing.pdf)'. This paper turned into another paper (Susmann et al., above). I wrote an R package to accompany the paper, which can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/MJAlexander/distortr). One day I might translate the models from JAGS to Stan.

# Code and other fun projects

- A package to fit Rogers-Castro migration models, `rcbayes`, is on [CRAN](https://cran.uib.no/web/packages/rcbayes/index.html). 
- I am a contributor to the [DemoTools](https://timriffe.github.io/DemoTools/) R package.
- I made a children's book in R called ['D is for Demography'](https://github.com/MJAlexander/d_is_for_demography). My toddler prefers 'The Very Hungry Caterpillar' or 'Wombat Stew'.
- [This repo](https://github.com/MJAlexander/states-mortality) on my GitHub has various bits and pieces of code, mostly related to mortality, but some other stuff too. 
- [Shiny app](https://monica-alexander.shinyapps.io/babynames_app/) to explore baby names in Australia, Ontario, and USA
- [Shiny app](https://monica-alexander.shinyapps.io/collections/) documenting some collections. (One day I hope to own a copy of all Agatha Christies.)
