I am an Associate Professor in [Statistical Sciences](http://www.utstat.utoronto.ca/) and [Sociology](http://sociology.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto. I received my PhD in Demography from the [University of California, Berkeley](http://demog.berkeley.edu/). My research interests include statistical demography, mortality and health inequalities, and computational social science. 

I have worked on research projects with the World Health Organization, UNICEF, UNHCR, and the [Human Mortality Database](http://mortality.org/). I was a 2016 Fellow at [Data Science for Social Good](https://dssg.uchicago.edu/), and previously worked at the ANU's [Centre for Aboriginal Economic Policy Research](http://caepr.anu.edu.au/).

I am passionate about increasing the representation of women in STEM and other quantitative fields. I maintain a list of [women scholars in demography](https://www.monicaalexander.com/women_scholars/). I also co-organize the [Formal Demography Working Group](https://formaldemography.github.io/working_group).

I am married to [Rohan Alexander](https://rohanalexander.com/) who is also at UofT. Outside of work I ~~am interested in photography, cycling, and music~~ have two children, and enjoy building Lego trains, reading stories (about trains), and dancing to songs (that mention trains or other vehicles). I run a bit and am on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/2041191).
