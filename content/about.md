I am an Assistant Professor in [Statistical Sciences](http://www.utstat.utoronto.ca/) and [Sociology](http://sociology.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto. I received my PhD in Demography from the [University of California, Berkeley](http://demog.berkeley.edu/). My research interests include statistical demography, mortality and health inequalities, and computational social science. 

I have worked on research projects with the World Health Organization, UNICEF, UNHCR, and the [Human Mortality Database](http://mortality.org/). I was a 2016 Fellow at [Data Science for Social Good](https://dssg.uchicago.edu/), and have worked at the ANU's [Centre for Aboriginal Economic Policy Research](http://caepr.anu.edu.au/).

I am passionate about increasing the representation of women in STEM and other quantitative fields. I co-organize [RLadies Toronto](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-toronto/) and maintain a list of [women scholars in demography](https://www.monicaalexander.com/women_scholars/).

I am married to [Rohan Alexander](https://rohanalexander.com/) who is also faculty at UofT (and not a Jamaican-American cricketer as Google suggests). Outside of work I ~~am interested in photography, cycling, and music~~ I have two children, and enjoy buildling Lego, reading stories, and dancing to The Wiggles.
