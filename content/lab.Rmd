The Bayesian Demography Lab brings together researchers from demography, statistics, sociology and public health to work on projects related to statistical demography and the study of demographic inequalities. Current projects are wide ranging, and include: 

- the estimation of maternal cause of death; 
- improving methodologies for estimating stateless populations;
- using social media data in demographic research; 
- forecasting foster care populations in the US; 
- understanding various demand and supply aspects of the opioid epidemic; 
- estimating mortality using geneaology data; and 
- various topics related to migration estimation and health.
