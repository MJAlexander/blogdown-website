title: "Women in Demography"
---

An ever-growing list of active scholars in demography who identify as women or as a gender minority, listed by broad sub-discipline, and with two notable papers.[^1] [^2]

[^1]: Thanks to Rohan Alexander, Paul Chung, Robert Pickett and Leslie Root for their help in compiling the initial list.

[^2]: At some point I plan to add Twitter handles to this list too (as suggested by Ilya Kashnitsky, this would also be a good way to see networks); this will maybe happen after semester ends. If anyone would like to volunteer to do this, let me know :)

If you or someone you know should be on this list and isn't, please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdb1XObnbO4KP0Xg65gakYA-CO_78OZFU7KPfddxdJJnehUtg/viewform).  If you are on this list and would like different papers highlighted, or if you see any mistakes, email me!

Sub-disciplines are:[^3]

- Family, social demography
- Fertility
- Mathematical, statistical, digital demography, population projection
- Migration, environment, economic demography
- Mortality, health, aging, biodemography

[^3]: As this list has grown the discipline categories have become less useful. At some point I will change the categories to be more informative (again, if anyone would like to volunteer to do this, get in touch :) )
